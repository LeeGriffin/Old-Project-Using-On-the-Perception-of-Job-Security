# Old-Project-Using-On-the-Perception-of-Job-Security
This is an old paper (Spring 2017) I did in my graduate program that looked at the perception of job security. Uses Stata, and the  GSS dataset.

Some intresting things might me recoding the GSS dataset to useable data, examples of timeseries logit and probit models (and one ordered logit). Some Hausam tests and BIC/AIC tests that were used to find the correct model for my data. And finally, examples of margins and odds ratios being used so I can interpet my final logit model.
