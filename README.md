# Old-Project-Using-On-the-Perception-of-Job-Security
This is an old project (Spring 2017) that I did in my graduate program that looked at how different characteristics affected the perception of job security. Uses Stata, and the GSS (General Social Survey) dataset.

Some interesting bits might be recoding the GSS dataset to useable data, examples of time series logit and probit models (and one ordered logit). Some Hausam tests and BIC/AIC tests that were used to find the correct model for my data. And finally, examples of margins and odds ratios being used to interpret my final logit model.

I have also included the GSS time-series data file that I used (although, at this point it is old). But the variable names should be the same. There are also some comments in the file that explain what I was thinking at the time.
